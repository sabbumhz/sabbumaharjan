                                    I am a very artistic person from an early age, I have always been active in drawing, painting, sketching and anything that includes colors, details and structure. As the flow of art has a diverse route, I developed my interest in web designing and found it an amazing platform to demonstrate the form of art. I've enjoyed developing and bringing the design files into visual elements that users see and interact with in a web application. I've always researched and explored subjects and paths that have directly and indirectly helped me groom in a personal and professional life. I was never afraid to learn new things and pull out experiments with different ideas.

                                    I have completed my Bachelors degree in <strong>Electronics and communication Engineering</strong> from Kantipur Engineering College(TU Board, Nepal). During my final year, we were supposed to deliver a project and we made a project named <strong>"MEDICAL SYSTEMATIC TRANSPORT AND ASSISTANT ROBOT (2017-2018)"</strong>, while my team members were working on the hardware and software development, I was drawn more towards the UX and UI experience of the people while using the application. I have self-taught many web designing components like HTML, CSS at this time. This was the first time I actually started writing my own set of html and css codes. It was just the beginning of my new interest.

                                    In the very beginning of my professional life, I started as an <strong>intern</strong> at <strong><a class="hover-link" target="_blank" href="https://codevibrant.com/">CodeVibrant</a></strong> when I first got professional guidance from my seniors. Within a month I have started live projects. <strong>WordPress Themes</strong> were the one I first started with, where I had to consider different layouts and customization, and also perfecting every design expected, it was challenging and at the same time there was satisfaction of developing the theme. Uploading those themes to wordpress.org and checking the active installation of the theme was our daily routine. After a year, the hunger to learn grew more and I joined another company<strong><a class="hover-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.andmine.com/">AndMine Nepal</a></strong> as a <strong>UX/UI Developer</strong>. Client projects were completely new to me this time, I learned about the clients requirements and client communication, where i first delivered my first client project <strong><a href="https://xavier.vic.edu.au/" target="_blank" class="hover-link">'Xavier'</a></strong>. I have improved my communication by this time virtual and in person after the lockdown is over after COVID-19. Virtual work from home has improved communication skills for most people and so did mine And again, challenging myself and to learn, i started working for <strong><a href="https://outside.studio/" target="_blank" class="hover-link">'Outside Tech'</a></strong> as <strong>Frontend Developer</strong>. And today, I have worked on different platforms like <strong>WordPress </strong>,<strong>Shopify</strong>, Drupal, ModX, BigCommerce, Bizaaboo and Wix. <strong>Shopify</strong> being my latest learning and will continue to explore. My latest project would be <strong><a href="https://meetlalo.com/" target="_blank">meetlalo</a></strong> based on Shopify 2.0 DAWN theme. It was a wonderful experience to learn and to develop. As I was always amused by the different websites we visit everyday, then I started to explore more and more of the inspiration and diverse websites. By the time, with guidance from seniors and high dedication on learning , I was able to improve my skills and web designing knowledge.

                                    Over 3 years, as a Front-end Developer, I have designed and developed highly responsive websites and ecommerce solutions and developed proficiency in HTML, CSS, SCSS, Jquery and Javascript and code versioning tools, such as GIT. While developing these technical skills, I have always been a people person, trying to plan the flow of work. I believe 'Communication' and 'Technical Skills' both go hand in hand when it comes to building up our personality and effective work. In addition, I have consistently met client expectations and project milestones while working effectively in deadline-driven environments. I have been involved in discussion sessions of the frontend development environment, planning of the project, training and guiding the interns and onboarding new team members into the office environment and the frontend development of the company.

                                    I know how important the details are for a Front End Developer. My keen attention to detail and dedication has always helped me in my professional life. I have always been focused on my career and I am not ready to settle yet. I would like to learn as many frontend platforms as possible. Web Design and Front-end Development is a very vast subject, it helps us grow and it will never fail us to challenge us. I would love to study design at an academic level. I have learnt it by practise until today but I would love to groom and to improvise myself academically as well. I am planning for an academic qualification that would boost up my profession and diversify my knowledge in the field. Learning SEO principles, and sharpen and add up the skills.
