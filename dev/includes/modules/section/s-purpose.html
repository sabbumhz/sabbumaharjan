                        I am a very artistic person from a early age, I have always been active in drawing, paintings, sketching and anything that includes colors, details and structure. As the flow of art have a diverse route, I developed my interest in web designing and found it a amazing platform to demonstrate the form of art. I've been enjoyed developing and bringing the design files into visual elements that user see and interact with in a web application. I've always researched and explored subjects and paths that have directly and indirectly helped me groom me in a personal and professional life. I was never afraid to learn new things and pull out experiment with different ideas.

                        I have completed my Bachelors degree in <strong>Electronics and communication Engineering</strong> from Kantipur Engineering College(TU Board, Nepal). During my final year, we were supposed to deliver a project and we made a project named <strong>"MEDICAL SYSTEMATIC TRANSPORT AND ASSISTANT ROBOT (2017-2018)"</strong>, while my team members were working on the hardware and software development, I was drawn more towards the UX and UI experience of the people while using the application. I have self-taught many web designing components like HTML, CSS at this time. This was the first time i actually started writing my own set of html and css codes. It was just the begining of my new interest.
